# connectwise-asio-mcp

**ConnectWise Asio** MCP server — exposes the ConnectWise Platform APIs (the "Current API" behind ConnectWise Asio, formerly SolarWinds MSP/N-central-adjacent RMM) as MCP tools.

> **Naming note:** app.mspbots.ai calls this integration **"ConnectWise Asio"** (`sys_integration.subject_code = CWASIO`). It is a distinct product from ConnectWise Command (Continuum), ConnectWise Manage (PSA), and ConnectWise Automate — each has its own MCP server in this fleet. The underlying API is officially named **"ConnectWise Platform APIs"** in its OpenAPI spec (`developer.connectwise.com` — "REST API" doc under Products > ConnectWise Platform > Platform Vendors > APIs and Callbacks).

## Overview

This server implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Streamable HTTP/SSE transport) and wraps the ConnectWise Platform APIs — **15 tools** across 4 categories (`devices`, `companies_contacts`, `patching`, `automation`), trimmed to the core MSP RMM workflow: find a company/site, find its devices, check device health and patch status (see Tool List below; originally a full-API build of 107 operations across 24 tag categories, then a 25-tool MSPbots-configured-endpoints trim, then this 15-tool core-workflow trim on 2026-08-26 — see Known Gaps for what was cut and why). It follows the MSPbots **Vendor MCP Service SOP**: stateless, no stored credentials, per-request header authentication.

The underlying API authenticates via **OAuth2 Client Credentials**. This server does not perform the token exchange itself — it receives an already-obtained bearer access token per request (matching how other OAuth-flow integrations, e.g. Microsoft Graph, are handled in this MSPbots MCP fleet: the gateway mints/refreshes the token from `client_id`/`client_secret`/`scope`, and only the resulting token reaches this server).

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Local (uv)

```bash
uv sync
python -m connectwise_asio_mcp
```

## Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# {"status": "ok"}
```

No token is required for the health endpoint.

## 授权参数说明 (Authentication)

Every request to `/mcp` must include the following HTTP headers:

| Header | 类型 | 是否必填 | 默认值 | 枚举值 | 字段描述 | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Token` | string | 必填 | 无 | 无(自由文本) | OAuth2 bearer access token,由调用方(Agent Platform / 上游网关)通过 `POST /v1/token`(client_credentials grant,需 client_id + client_secret + scope)预先换取并负责刷新。本服务从不接触 client_id/client_secret,只转发已获取的 token。 | `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Token: <access_token>` |
| `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Base-Url` | string | 可选 | `CONNECTWISE_ASIO_BASE_URL` 环境变量(默认 `https://openapi.service.itsupport247.net`) | `https://openapi.service.itsupport247.net`(NA)、`https://openapi.service.euplatform.connectwise.com`(EU)、`https://openapi.service.auplatform.connectwise.com`(AU) | ConnectWise Asio 按账号所属地区分 3 个独立服务器(Client ID 前缀 0e30=NA/0e31=EU/0e32=AU 可判断地区);不带该 header 时用环境变量默认值,网关同时服务多地区租户时按请求覆盖。 | `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Base-Url: https://openapi.service.euplatform.connectwise.com` |

Missing `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Token` returns `401 Unauthorized`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | Listening port |
| `MCP_HTTP_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Listening host |
| `CONNECTWISE_ASIO_BASE_URL` | `https://openapi.service.itsupport247.net` | Default regional server; override per-request with `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Base-Url` |

## MCP Endpoint

```
POST http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

Connect your MCP client with:
- Transport: `http` (Streamable HTTP / SSE)
- Headers: `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Token: <access_token>` (required), `X-ConnectWise-Asio-Base-Url: <base_url>` (optional)

## Tool List

**15 tools.** History: an original 104-tool full-API build (covering every ConnectWise Platform APIs operation) was trimmed on 2026-08-04 to 25 tools matching MSPbots' actually-configured 23 endpoints. On 2026-08-26, a further trim to these 15 tools extracted the core MSP RMM workflow — find a company/site, find its devices, check device health and patch status — after an intent-matching test pass found the removed tools added surface area (and real description/schema gaps) without matching real usage. If a removed tool/category is needed later, the vendor's OpenAPI spec (linked below) still documents its exact operations and it can be re-added the same way the kept tools were generated; git history has the removed tools' implementations verbatim.

**Removed in the 2026-08-26 trim** (10 tools): the entire Custom Fields category (6 tools — config/metadata management, not core monitoring), `connectwise_asio_create_company` (the only write tool; client onboarding isn't an agent task — this server is now fully read-only), `connectwise_asio_get_site` (redundant with `get_company_sites`), `connectwise_asio_get_endpoint_applications` (software-inventory audit, niche), `connectwise_asio_get_endpoint_system_state` (overlapped with the cpu/memory/disk/services tools and had an ambiguous own description).

**Known gap carried over from the original build**: MSPbots configured two endpoints — "ConnectWise Asio Suspension" (`GET /v2/alerting/suspensions`) and "ConnectWise Asio Suspension Details" (`GET /v2/alerting/suspensions/{ruleid}`) — that have **no corresponding tool** in this server at all (the original 104-tool build's `alerting` category only ever implemented create/update/delete/post-incident operations, never a GET-suspension read). This predates both trims. See Known Gaps below.

## 测试示例 (Test Example)

Get a company list, then its sites:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "connectwise_asio_get_companies", "arguments": {} }
}
```

Equivalent `curl` against the running server (streamable HTTP MCP endpoint):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-ConnectWise-Asio-Token: <access_token>" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": { "name": "connectwise_asio_get_companies", "arguments": {} }
  }'
```

A parameterized call:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "connectwise_asio_get_endpoint_cpu_usage",
    "arguments": { "endpoint_id": "abc-123" }
  }
}
```

## Known Gaps / Not Yet Verified

- **Trimmed twice**: 104 tools (full API spec) → 25 tools on 2026-08-04
  (MSPbots' actually-configured endpoints) → **15 tools on 2026-08-26**
  (core RMM workflow only — see Tool List above for exactly what was cut
  each time and why). If a removed tool/category is needed later, the
  vendor's OpenAPI spec (linked below) still documents its exact
  operations and it can be re-added the same way the kept tools were
  generated; git history has every removed tool's implementation verbatim.
- **MSPbots' configured "Suspension"/"Suspension Details" endpoints have no
  corresponding tool** — this gap predates both trims (the original
  104-tool build's `alerting` category never implemented a GET-suspension
  read operation, only create/update/delete/post-incident). If suspension
  data is actually needed, this would need to be added from the vendor's
  OpenAPI spec.
- Not yet tested against a live ConnectWise Asio account — only
  protocol-level verification (health check, 401 on missing token,
  `tools/list` returning all 15 tools) plus an intent-matching test pass
  (real dispatch against a local server with a dummy token — confirms
  tool/argument selection, not live API behavior) has been done so far.
- This server is now fully read-only (both write tools — `create_company`,
  `update_company_custom_fields` — were removed in the 2026-08-26 trim).
- `connectwise_asio_get_os_patch_compliance_summary`'s `resource_type`
  accepting values other than `"endpoints"` (e.g. a company/site-level
  rollup) is unverified — the vendor's docs are behind a login wall. Its
  sibling `connectwise_asio_get_os_patch_details` is confirmed
  endpoints-only.
